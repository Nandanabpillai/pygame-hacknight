## How it Works ?
The motive of the project is to reimagine one of the all-time favorites, the Dinosaur Game. The project is a collaborative approach to give a new and improved look to the UI of the game, using the different pygame modules. The idea is to create a more chalenging game setup for the user, with visual snd sound effects, which means more fun... 

In the design setup, we have given a colourful and modern look to the game, by using newer animations,sound designs and backgrounds, but at the same time, not compromising the different accurate and fun features of the game. The user can experience a new visual level of the game, whereas the fun of playing it never leaves...

Let our old Dino get an update too...
